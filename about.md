title: About me 
---

My name is Patrick Barrett. I'm an Applications Engineer at [Exosite] in
Minneapolis, MN.

That title is almost completely meaningless, I work on projects that span the
range between writing embedded C code to documenting HTTP APIs and helping
customers design their applications and work though development issues.
